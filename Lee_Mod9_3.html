    <p>Don't confuse a fall with a failure, GET BACK UP!!!</p>
    <p>Don't give up get up! The righteous may fall but they get back up. I am either up or I am getting up. Even when we fall God has a plan for our redemption. Don't allow distractions to knock you off course. Live your life. Life is a journey not a destination. There are no mistakes just chances we've taken. Whether you are on time or behind you want to be moving in the right direction. Finish your race. There's always a temptation in every race to quit it. </p>
    <p>Sabrina (1954) Audrey Hepburn,"Dearest Father, I have learned how to live...how to be in the world and of the world... and not to just stand aside and watch. And I will never, never again run away from life... or from love, either.. I am taking the plane home on friday, Father. If you'd have any difficulty recognizing your daughter, I shall be the most sophisticated woman at the Glen Cove Station."</p>
