        <h2>All About Chynna</h2>

        <p class="intro"> Hi my name is Chynna Lee. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. I have two yorkipoos whom I love with all my heart. </p>
        <p> I now live in Dallas, Texas. I love software development, because it's the closest thing to magic. I love typing out code and watching my code come to life. </p>
        <p> The only thing that gets me are the long hours it takes me to fully create a website. I have made several multi-responsive web pages but my favorite was a weather app using API. I hope I learn a faster way to code through this course.</p>
        <p> It's crazy to me to see how far I've come. Growing up I always felt intrigued by the gifted classes and the use of robotics, but I never felt skilled enough. I thank myself for believing in my creativity and ability to create websites and apps. <span class="sentence">This is a highlighted sentence.</span></p>
